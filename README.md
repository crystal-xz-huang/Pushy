# Pushy: Version Control System

## Overview
Pushy is a simple but powerful subset of the version control system Git.
This project implements core version control functionalities using POSIX-compatible shell scripts. 
Each script corresponds to a fundamental Git command, providing basic version control capabilities.

## Commands
Pushy includes the following commands, each implemented as a shell script:

1. `pushy-init`: Initializes a new, empty repository.
2. `pushy-add`: Adds file contents to the index.
3. `pushy-commit`: Records changes to the repository.
4. `pushy-log`: Shows the commit logs.
5. `pushy-show`: Displays a file at a specific commit.
6. `pushy-rm`: Removes files from the working directory and the index.
7. `pushy-status`: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
8. `pushy-branch`: Manages branches.
9. `pushy-checkout`: Switches branches or restores working tree files.
10. `pushy-merge`: Merges two branches.
